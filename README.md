Cavlog – User Panel

- Project overview:
Cavlog – User Panel is a full-featured and intuitive barber booking application developed using Flutter and Firebase, designed to offer users a seamless and intelligent grooming appointment experience. From booking preferred barbers to managing real-time chats and payments, the app covers all aspects of modern salon scheduling. Users can easily authenticate using Firebase Email, Phone, or Google Sign-In, browse through barber portfolios, and book time slots based on availability using a smart scheduling system. To enhance convenience, live location tracking lets users track their barber's arrival, while OTP verification ensures booking security.
The app supports multiple payment methods, including Stripe integration, wallet top-ups, and online payments, with an added real-time INR to USD currency conversion feature during top-ups. A built-in review and rating system allows users to share feedback, enhancing trust and service quality. Additionally, voice search and advanced filtering (by price, rating, location, and availability) improve service discovery, while push notifications keep users updated on appointments and offers. Designed with a clean and responsive UI/UX, the app ensures smooth performance across devices.
